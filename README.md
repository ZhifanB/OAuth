The motivation behind this project topic is the common sport hobbies across the entire project team. All team members are interested in sports, including soccer, tennis, and basketball, snowboarding, etc. With this background, we would like to provide a handy analyzed tool to our users who are interested in basketball.

Our project uses datasets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 2000 to 2021. Besides displaying players’ statistics and game results, this project intends to provide users with data visualized analysis, including customized selected players performance, player’s most frequent events, ranks of a team among multiple factors in League and suggested best fit player for a team’s weakest factor.
